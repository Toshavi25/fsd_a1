 <h1>About us....</h1>

<p> The dream of BJM Carmel Academy dawned in 1996 in the mind of Rev. Fr Mathew Kaniamparampil, the then President of CMI Service Society, an educational society owned and managed by the CMI Fathers.
The school has completed 20 years in 2016. At Present Rev.Fr. BENNY MUKALEL is the President of the Society and Rev. Fr. BINOY CHENKONTHAYIL, the Principal of the school. Carmel Academy will continue to be the No.1 school with the hard work and dedication of the management and staff in the years to come.</p>
